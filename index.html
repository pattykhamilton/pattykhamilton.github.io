				<p>Reviews:</p>

				<p><i>Peeling Oranges, by the Jane Chambers Award Jury:</i></br>
				The five final round judges were energized and intrigued by (the) work's depth and breadth of imagery. Adjudicators emphasized the poetic, embodied force and nuanced specificity of (the) themes, attuned to Asian, Asian-American and mixed cultural identity and were compelled by the inner life crafted for daughters, mothers and sisters coming of age and across lives, facing The Great Sadness. Haunting and hybridic, artful and pragmatic, signature images included for us the ancestral presence of the family's Halmeoni and Frida Kahlo on the lawn, always: we loved the way the play reimagines form, relationships, "home," life and choice.  Elegant in language, deeply feminist in insights—"At some point you can't remember what exactly it is, stored in your body" —this play  excavates cross-cultural, generational legacies in unexpected ways, which are both creative and potent. In a cadre of strong finalists, we commend (the) array of significant female roles, particularly for women of Asian descent, your intersectional approach to storytelling and intertwining of queer themes and genderqueer possibilities with the play's complex listening to loss, isolation, mental health and identity. All readers were energized by your layering of dream, everyday and (cross-cultural) ancestral space.</p>

				<p><i>Sex Play, by the European Theatre Convention jury:</i><br>
				Patty Kim Hamilton’s Sex Play portrays with talent the increasingly complicated topics of human sexuality and gender identities, as well as the stress, frustration and sometimes violence these topics carry. Itscotemporary composition and structure give a voice to an undefined number of characters in a series of situations and conversations, in which the author combines a very delicate balance between poetry and realistic, humorous writing, with organic and believable dialogues.</p>
